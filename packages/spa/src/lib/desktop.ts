/**
 * Desktop-shell detection.
 *
 * The Electron preload bridge injects `window.reviewer` (see
 * packages/desktop/src/preload.ts). When present we're running inside the
 * native window, where the macOS traffic lights sit over the top-left of the
 * web content (`titleBarStyle: "hiddenInset"`) — the window bar reserves space
 * for them. In the plain browser the bridge is absent and no space is reserved.
 *
 * SPA-only (no SSR), so reading `window` at module load is safe.
