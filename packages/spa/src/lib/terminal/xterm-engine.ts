/**
 * Shared xterm.js engine — one place that creates and configures every terminal
 * in the app (the thread terminals in components/threads/Terminal.tsx and the
 * Local Dev terminals in components/local-dev/DevTerminal.tsx), so they render
 * identically. Both used to inline a bare xterm with only the FitAddon and the
 * default DOM renderer; agent TUIs (Claude Code / opencode / Codex) repaint a
 * full screen many times a second and the DOM renderer flickers, shears the cell
 * grid and leaves artifacts under that load — "agents render broken."
 *
 * This mirrors how Hyper and VS Code (whose team builds xterm.js) render their
 * terminals:
 *   - a GPU renderer (@xterm/addon-webgl) for a pixel-perfect, flicker-free cell
 *     grid, with a graceful fall back to the Canvas renderer and finally the DOM
 *     renderer when WebGL2 is unavailable or its context is lost;
 *   - Unicode 11 width tables (@xterm/addon-unicode11) so box-drawing glyphs,
 *     emoji and powerline symbols occupy the right number of cells instead of
 *     shearing the layout;
 *   - clickable URLs (@xterm/addon-web-links);
 *   - a complete, theme-matched 16-colour ANSI palette for both light and dark
 *     (xterm's built-in palette is tuned for a black background, so on the app's
 *     light theme the default blues/yellows/bright-white were near-invisible).
 *
 * The background is deliberately transparent in both themes: a terminal paints
 * no surface of its own and takes whatever it is mounted on — the app canvas,
 * and through it the native window's vibrancy — so it never shows as a black
 * rectangle punched through a light window (or the reverse).
 *
 * The engine is imported lazily by callers so xterm never runs during
 * SSR/prerender.
