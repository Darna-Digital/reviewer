/**
 * Lazy, failure-tolerant loader for the `node-pty` native module — shared by
 * every part of the server that spawns a PTY (the terminal-threads socket and
 * the Local Dev process manager).
 *
 * node-pty is a native addon, so loading it can fail where the prebuilt binary
 * is missing or ABI-incompatible (e.g. a packaged Electron build before it has
 * been rebuilt for Electron's Node ABI). We load it lazily and return `null`
 * on failure so callers can degrade to a clear error instead of crashing the
 * whole server. `createRequire` works both under tsx (ESM) and in the esbuild
 * CJS bundle, where node-pty is kept external.
 *
 * (pty-socket.ts carries an equivalent inline loader for now; it can be pointed
 * at this module once the terminal-threads work settles.)

 * does not preserve file modes), and then every spawn fails with the opaque
 * "posix_spawnp failed." — no terminal, server otherwise healthy. Restore +x
